# Performance Report Script

This directory contains scripts for analyzing and reporting on the performance of the Logic Evolution Engine (LEE).

## `generate_simple_performance_report.py`

### Purpose

The `generate_simple_performance_report.py` script is designed to process performance log files (typically CSV format) generated by the LEE system. It provides a comprehensive summary of an evolutionary run.

The script performs the following actions:
1.  Reads a specified performance log CSV file.
2.  Calculates and aggregates key summary statistics. The report includes:
    *   The highest fitness score achieved overall.
    *   The average fitness score for each generation.
    *   The total number of unique DNA structures observed.
    *   **Advanced Performance Metrics (averaged across applicable DNA individuals):**
        *   Overall Sharpe Ratio.
        *   Maximum Drawdown (as a percentage).
        *   Winning Trade Percentage.
        *   Average Trade Profit/Loss (per unit, based on BUY/SELL pairs).
    *   **Motif Usage Analysis:**
        *   Identifies the top 3 most frequently occurring indicator-based motifs (e.g., `Indicator_RSI_14`).
        *   Reports their frequency.
        *   Compares the average fitness of DNAs containing these motifs against the overall average fitness.
        *   Includes a "Motif-Regime Correlation Hints" section, which provides insights into the typical market conditions (CES vectors from the `ces_vector_at_evaluation_time` column in the log) associated with the top DNA motifs by showing the most frequent CES vector for each top motif.
3.  Generates a consolidated report of these statistics.

### Output Format

The script now outputs its findings directly to the console in **Markdown format**. This allows for easy readability and can be copied into Markdown-compatible documents or wikis.

### How to Run

To execute the script, navigate to the root directory of the project and use the following command structure:

**Basic Command (using default log file):**

```bash
python scripts/generate_simple_performance_report.py
```

This command will attempt to read the default performance log file, which is `performance_log_FULL_V1_2.csv`, expected to be located in the project root directory (`/app/performance_log_FULL_V1_2.csv` in the sandbox environment).

**Specifying a Log File Path:**

You can specify a different log file using the `--log_file_path` argument:

```bash
python scripts/generate_simple_performance_report.py --log_file_path /path/to/your/performance_log.csv
```

Replace `/path/to/your/performance_log.csv` with the actual path to your CSV file.

**Example:**

If your log file is named `my_experiment_log.csv` and is located in a directory called `lee_results` within your home directory, the command might look like:

```bash
python scripts/generate_simple_performance_report.py --log_file_path ~/lee_results/my_experiment_log.csv
```

### Configurability

The script's internal logging behavior (e.g., verbosity of its own processing messages, not the content of the generated report) can be configured via a `config.ini` file placed in the project's root directory. Specifically, the `level` setting under the `[Logging]` section in `config.ini` will be used if the `src.utils.logging_utils` module is available to the script. If not found, basic logging is used.
